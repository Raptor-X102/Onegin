A dying man with art to soothe,
And nothing more important sees;
And physic bring with mournful face,
A paragon of virtue he!
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
But cannot stand the northern cold.(2)
But what a nuisance it will be,
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,(1)
Have shone as one of fashion’s leaders.
He hath acquired the world’s esteem
I also wandered there of old,
If he hath disease;
Inheritor of all his race.
It may be ye were born, or there
Let me present ye to the man,
"My uncle’s goodness is extreme,
Onéguine, O my gentle readers,
The hero is of my narration!
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
To sigh and meditate alone:
Was born beside the Neva, where
When will the devil take his own"
Who without more prevarication
Without a chance to slip away.
Ye need dissimulation base

But cannot stand the northern cold.(2)
